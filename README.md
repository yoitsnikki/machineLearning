codes for my class on machine learning

a bit disorganized at time but the table of contents is here

### Unit 1 - linear regression
linregression.py - main, one line code

regressionP2.py - 3d code

quadratic.py - variable full code that adjusts the line based on the curve, which can now have polynomials
