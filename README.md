codes for my class on machine learning

a bit disorganized at time but the table of contents is here

### Unit 1 - linear regression
linregression.py - main, one line code

regressionP2.py - 3d code

quadratic.py - variable full code that adjusts the line based on the curve, which can now have polynomials

### Unit 2 - Classification

decisionTree.py - main iris data code

naiveBayes.py - classification code around wording and grouping instead of characteristics

### Unit 3 - Validation

naiveBayes.py - validation on top of my classification code to see how accurate the program is

validation.py - a separate validation program for my original linear regression code (quadratic.py) and how accurate it is
